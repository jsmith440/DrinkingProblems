1. As a user with strong math skills and an affinity for adult beverages, I want an app that will lock me out of my phone to prevent me from sending unwanted drunk texts or drunk dials.
   - I want to always have the option to make certain calls if my phone is locked for example 911, cab company (or access to Uber/Lyft...) and possibly certain contacts like best friend, spouse etc.
2. As a user (with or without strong math skills) I want to be able to lock myself out of my phone so that I won't get distracted from a task/working on a project/studying etc.
   - I want it to be inconvenient to unlock my phone, but not impossible.
   - I want the ability to additionally turn my phone's do not disturb preferences on or off so that I can or can't see notifications from texts/calls/social media etc.
