# Drinking Problems


* What's the basic functionality of the app?

  The app will ask you multiple choice difficult math questions to unlock the user's phone. If the user answers incorrectly OR doesn't answer within a given amount of time the questions will get more difficult.

* Construct at least 2 wireframe diagrams for your app; include them in your repository in PDF form.

* Who would find this app useful or fun, and when would they use it?

  The app will be for users who are drinking adult beverages and will prevent them from sending unwanted/bad decision texts and calls. This app would ask a preliminary set of questions to measure the ‘sober’ math abilities of the user. This app would be usable for users with basic math skills as well as mathematicians, engineers and other users with a strong math background. (Note: I have found an app that already does something similar but only asks simple arithmetic questions and doesn’t block access to the phone’s calculator.)

* Could this app be useful on its own, with no connection to the internet?

  Yes. The app could have a bank of questions stored on the device.

* What sort of data would this app use or share if it had a connection to the internet? 

  Using location data the app could see if a user is at a bar/brewery. Also when connected to the internet it could pull from a larger bank of questions.
I think I may have to create this bank of questions so that it will be formatted in a way that I can use, however some good sites are:

* Write at least 2 user stories.

1. As a user with strong math skills and an affinity for adult beverages, I want an app that will lock me out of my phone to prevent me from sending unwanted drunk texts or drunk dials.
   - I want to always have the option to make certain calls if my phone is locked for example 911, cab company (or access to Uber/Lyft...) and possibly certain contacts like best friend, spouse etc.
2. As a user (with or without strong math skills) I want to be able to lock myself out of my phone so that I won't get distracted from a task/working on a project/studing etc. 
   - I want it to be inconvient to unlock my phone, but not impossible.
   - I want the ability to additionaly turn my phone's do not disturb preferences on or off so that I can or can't see notifications from texts/calls/social media etc.
